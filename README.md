# Summer-2020-CS-Internships

Hello there, 

My name is Mohammad Ali, I'm another CS student just like many of you visiting this repo are. Internships are something we all want to get, yet however we get so caught up in the big names that we forget about the rest and then summer comes and we have no internship. This is why I wanted to make something that would give an extensive constantly updating list for all internships that I can find to apply for (on basis of a well-known off the tongue company only) that us CS majors could apply for. Now of course, I'm not going to have every single internship on this list but this will allow for you to have quite a large and extensive list to choose and apply from. Currently it's extremely terrible formatting with which if anyone would like to help, you can reach out to me privately on **Discord : @mvhxmmmvd#6072 or instagram @mvhxmmvd**. I really need help with formatting so once again please reach out to me if you'd be willing to help as I definetly could use it. Some of these have exact listings, some of these will take you to the companys respective search tool, either way I hope you guys can get what you are looking for and hopefully land an internship.
